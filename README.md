# 🚌 Transport Management Platform Implementation Plan (Pafar)

---

### ✅ 1. System Infrastructure & Project Setup

* Set up monorepo structure for:

  * **Backend** (`FastAPI`)
  * **Frontend** (`React + Vite`)
  * **Mobile App** (`Flutter`)
* Define CI/CD pipeline structure and containerization (Docker)
* Configure `.env`, settings management (prod/stage/dev)
* Setup PostgreSQL, Redis, and Alembic-based DB migration system

---

### ✅ 2. Core Domain Models and Schema

* Design models:

  * `User`, `Booking`, `Bus`, `Terminal`, `Trip`, `Payment`, `DriverLocation`
* Alembic migrations with indexes & constraints
* Pydantic schema validation
* Seed dev database with:

  * Routes, Buses, Terminals, Mock Users

---

### ✅ 3. Authentication and Passenger Management

* JWT Auth system (access/refresh tokens)
* Register/login + Email/SMS OTP verification
* Password reset + token validation
* Profile update and preferences
* Session audit logs per user

---

### ✅ 4. Trip Booking and Fleet Management

* Endpoint to:

  * Select route, choose bus seat, reserve trip
* Integrate fare calculation (distance, tier, timing)
* Assign bus and driver to each trip
* Define trip states: `Scheduled`, `En Route`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`
* Add cancellation support with reason & cutoff time

---

### 🛠️ 5. Live Fleet Tracking (In Progress)

* WebSocket-based live updates
* Broadcast driver location to customers en route
* Ride updates (e.g., `bus arrived`, `boarding now`)
* Endpoint to update driver GPS every 30s
* Use PostGIS or spatial queries for nearest-terminal logic

---

### 🗺️ 6. Maps & Route Optimization

* Integrate Google Maps or HERE API for:

  * Geocoding terminals
  * Route & ETA calculation
* Auto-complete city/terminal names
* Visual route plotting on booking screens

---

### 💳 7. Secure Payment System

* Integrate **Stripe** or **Paystack**
* Allow:

  * Card saving (with vault tokenization)
  * On-trip or pre-trip payment
* Generate e-receipts with trip summary
* Handle failed payments + retry queue
* Allow discounts, vouchers, or loyalty points

---

### 🌟 8. Reviews, Feedback & Ratings

* Allow passengers to:

  * Rate driver/bus after trip
  * Add textual feedback
* Admin UI to moderate reviews
* Average rating on driver/bus profile

---

### 🛠️ 9. Admin Control Center

* Admin login panel
* Dashboard: revenue, live trips, trip counts, active drivers
* Search and suspend users, manage terminals/buses
* Fraud detection triggers (e.g., booking abuse, payment retries)

---

### 💻 10. React Frontend (Web Portal)

* **Luxride HTML Template** (as base theme)
* Page components:

  * Home, Book Trip, My Bookings, Track Bus, Payment, Profile
* Admin panel with:

  * Trip mgmt, User mgmt, Reviews
* WebSocket integration for live tracking

---

### 📱 11. Flutter Mobile App

* Flutter (iOS + Android) setup
* Screens:

  * Login/Register
  * Trip Booking (w/ seat map)
  * Trip Tracking (live location)
  * Payment and Profile
* Push notifications for:

  * Booking confirmation
  * Bus arrival
  * Delays or cancellations

---

### ⚠️ 12. Error Handling and Observability

* Global exception middleware
* Consistent API error response schema
* Logging with trace ID per request
* Graceful fallback for 3rd-party API failures

---

### 🧪 13. Automated Testing

* `pytest` (backend), `jest` + RTL (frontend), `flutter_test`
* API and component-level tests
* E2E tests for:

  * Book Trip → Pay → Ride → Rate
* GitHub Actions for CI checks

---

### 🚀 14. Deployment

* Dockerize backend, frontend, mobile
* Nginx + SSL/TLS for web
* PostgreSQL & Redis containers
* GitHub Actions workflows for:

  * Dev deploy
  * Prod deploy
* Write runbook for:

  * Migration
  * Rollbacks
  * Backups

---
