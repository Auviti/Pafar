**Features**:
- Total and active user counts
- Booking statistics (total, pending, completed, cancelled)
- Revenue metrics (total and monthly)
- Trip statistics (active and total)
- Review moderation queue counts
- Fraud alert counts

### 3. User Management System ✅
**Search Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/admin/users/search`
**Management Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/manage`

**Features**:
- Advanced user search with filters (email, phone, role, status, dates)
- Pagination support
- User management actions:
  - Suspend user accounts
  - Activate suspended accounts
  - Verify user accounts
  - Reset user passwords
- Complete audit logging of all admin actions

### 4. Fleet Management Interface ✅
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/admin/fleet/assign`

- Conflict detection (prevents double-booking)
- Validation of bus, driver, and route availability
- Trip scheduling with fare setting
- Complete audit trail

### 5. Live Trip Monitoring ✅
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/admin/trips/live`

**Features**:
- Real-time data for active trips (boarding/in-transit)
- Current GPS location display
- Passenger count tracking
- Route and vehicle information
- Driver details and status

### 6. Review Moderation System ✅
**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/admin/reviews/unmoderated` - Get reviews needing moderation
- `GET /api/v1/admin/reviews/flagged` - Get flagged reviews
- `POST /api/v1/admin/reviews/{review_id}/moderate` - Moderate reviews

**Features**:
- Review approval/rejection
- Content flagging for investigation
- Review hiding capabilities
- Admin notes and reason tracking
- Pagination for large review volumes

### 7. Fraud Detection & Alert System ✅
**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/admin/fraud-alerts` - Get fraud alerts with filtering
- `POST /api/v1/admin/fraud-alerts/create` - Create manual alerts
- `POST /api/v1/admin/fraud-detection/trigger/{user_id}` - Trigger detection

**Features**:
- Automated fraud detection algorithms:
  - Rapid booking pattern detection
  - Multiple payment failure detection
  - High-value transaction monitoring
  - New account suspicious activity
- Alert severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Alert status tracking (open, investigating, resolved, false_positive)
- Manual alert creation for testing/reporting

### 8. System Health Monitoring ✅
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/admin/system/health`

**Features**:
- Database connectivity status
- Redis connectivity status
- API response time metrics
- System resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Active connection counts

## Technical Implementation

### Database Models
- **User model**: Extended with admin role support
- **Audit logging**: Redis-based activity logging for all admin actions
- **Fraud alerts**: Redis-based storage with JSON serialization

### Security Features
- **Role-based access**: All endpoints require admin role
- **JWT authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive request validation with Pydantic
- **Error handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database queries**: Optimized with proper indexing and eager loading
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Async operations**: Full async/await support for scalability

### Testing Coverage
- **Unit tests**: Comprehensive test suite with 21 test cases
- **Mock testing**: Proper mocking of external dependencies
- **Edge cases**: Testing of error conditions and edge cases
- **Test fixtures**: Reusable test data setup
