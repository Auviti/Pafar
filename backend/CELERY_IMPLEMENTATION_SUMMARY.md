## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/2

# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-password

# SMS Configuration
SMS_API_KEY=your-sms-api-key
SMS_API_URL=https://api.sms-provider.com/send

# Push Notifications
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/to/firebase-credentials.json
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting Celery Services

```bash
# Start worker
celery -A app.core.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# Start beat scheduler (for periodic tasks)
celery -A app.core.celery_app beat --loglevel=info

# Start flower monitoring (optional)
celery -A app.core.celery_app flower
```

### Using Tasks in Code

```python
from app.tasks.email_tasks import send_booking_confirmation_email
from app.tasks.sms_tasks import send_trip_departure_sms

# Send email asynchronously
booking_data = {
    "booking_reference": "BK123456",
    "origin": "New York",
    "destination": "Boston",
    # ... other booking details
}

email_task = send_booking_confirmation_email.delay(
    "user@example.com",
    "John Doe", 
    booking_data
)

# Send SMS notification
trip_data = {
    "booking_reference": "BK123456",
    "departure_time": "2024-01-15 10:00:00",
    # ... other trip details
}

sms_task = send_trip_departure_sms.delay(
    "+1234567890",
    "John Doe",
    trip_data
)
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

- **Email Tasks Tests**: 8 test cases covering success/failure scenarios

python test_celery_setup.py
```

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Built-in Monitoring

- Task execution tracking with Redis storage
- Worker health monitoring
- Queue length monitoring
- Failure rate tracking
- Performance metrics collection

### Health Check Endpoints

The monitoring utilities can be integrated into FastAPI health check endpoints:

```python
from app.utils.task_monitoring import health_checker

@app.get("/health/tasks")
async def task_health():
    return await health_checker.get_comprehensive_health_report()
```

## Production Deployment

### Docker Configuration

```dockerfile
# Celery worker
FROM python:3.11
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["celery", "-A", "app.core.celery_app", "worker", "--loglevel=info"]
```

### Process Management

- Use supervisor or systemd for process management
- Configure separate processes for worker and beat
- Set up log rotation and monitoring
- Configure resource limits and scaling

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features

- **Queue Routing**: Tasks routed to appropriate queues for better resource utilization
- **Connection Pooling**: Redis connection pooling for better performance
- **Task Batching**: Bulk operations for push notifications
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff to prevent system overload
- **Resource Limits**: Task time limits and worker prefetch settings

### Scaling

- Horizontal scaling with multiple worker processes
- Queue-specific workers for different task types
- Load balancing across multiple Redis instances
- Monitoring and auto-scaling based on queue lengths

## Security Considerations

- **Credential Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Task Validation**: Input validation for all task parameters
