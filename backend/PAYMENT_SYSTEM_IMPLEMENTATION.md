- Reusable payment methods

### ✅ 6. Add Payment Failure Handling and Retry Logic

**Files:** `app/services/payment_service.py`, `app/api/v1/payments.py`

- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful failure recovery

**Key Features:**
- `PaymentServiceError`, `PaymentNotFoundError`, `PaymentProcessingError`
- Retry mechanism with new payment intents
- Error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages

### ✅ 7. Generate E-receipts with Trip Details

**Files:** `app/utils/receipt_generator.py`, `app/api/v1/payments.py`

- HTML receipt generation with styling
- Plain text receipt generation
- Receipt data summarization
- Download endpoints for receipts

**Key Features:**
- Professional HTML templates
- Trip details integration
- Multiple format support
- Downloadable receipts

### ✅ 8. Write Unit Tests for Payment Service

**Files:** `tests/test_payment_service.py`, `test_payment_*.py`

- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock-based testing for external services
- Error scenario testing

**Test Coverage:**
- Payment intent creation
- Payment confirmation
- Payment method tokenization
- Webhook event handling
- Receipt generation
- Error handling scenarios

## Database Schema

The payment system includes a complete database schema with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'USD',
    payment_method payment_method_enum,
    payment_gateway payment_gateway_enum,
    gateway_transaction_id VARCHAR(255),
    status payment_status_enum DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Endpoints

The payment system exposes the following REST API endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/payments/payment-intent` - Create payment intent
- `POST /api/v1/payments/confirm` - Confirm payment
- `POST /api/v1/payments/payment-methods` - Create payment method token
- `GET /api/v1/payments/payment-methods` - Get saved payment methods
- `POST /api/v1/payments/retry` - Retry failed payment
- `GET /api/v1/payments/receipt/{payment_id}` - Get receipt data
- `GET /api/v1/payments/receipt/{payment_id}/download` - Download receipt
- `POST /api/v1/payments/webhook` - Stripe webhook handler

## Configuration

The system requires the following environment variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-stripe-publishable-key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your-stripe-webhook-secret
```

## Security Features

- PCI DSS compliant card handling (via Stripe)
- Webhook signature verification
- JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
- Secure token storage
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with ORM

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with:
- Custom exception hierarchy
- Stripe error mapping
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback mechanisms

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock-based testing for external services
- Error scenario coverage
- End-to-end payment flow testing
