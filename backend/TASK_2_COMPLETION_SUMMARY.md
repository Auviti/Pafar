# Task 2 Completion Summary: Core Data Models and Database Schema

## Overview
Task 2 has been successfully completed. All core data models and database schema have been implemented with proper SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas, database migrations, indexes, and seeding scripts.

## Completed Components

### 1. SQLAlchemy Models ✅

All core models have been implemented in `app/models/`:

  - UUID primary key
  - User type enumeration (CUSTOMER, DRIVER, ADMIN)
  - Authentication fields (email, phone, password_hash)
  - Profile information (full_name, profile_image_url)
  - Rating system (average_rating, total_rides)
  - Account status (is_verified, is_active)
  - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

#### Ride Model (`app/models/ride.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages ride lifecycle from request to completion
- **Key Features**:
  - UUID primary key
  - Customer and driver relationships
  - Pickup and destination location relationships
  - Status enumeration (REQUESTED, ACCEPTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
  - Fare tracking (estimated_fare, actual_fare)
  - Duration tracking (estimated_duration, actual_duration)
  - Distance tracking
  - Complete timestamp tracking for all ride states
  - Cancellation reason support

#### Location Model (`app/models/ride.py`)
- **Purpose**: Stores pickup and destination locations
- **Key Features**:
  - UUID primary key
  - GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - Address information (address, city, country, postal_code)
  - Creation timestamp

#### Payment Model (`app/models/payment.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles payment processing and transaction history
- **Key Features**:
  - UUID primary key
  - Ride and user relationships
  - Stripe integration (payment_method_id, stripe_payment_intent_id)
  - Amount and currency tracking
  - Status enumeration (PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED, REFUNDED)
  - Complete timestamp tracking

#### DriverLocation Model (`app/models/ride.py`)
- **Purpose**: Real-time driver location tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - UUID primary key
  - Driver relationship (unique constraint)
  - GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - Movement data (heading, speed)
  - Availability status
  - Real-time update timestamp

### 2. Database Migrations ✅

Comprehensive Alembic migrations have been implemented:

#### Initial Migration (`4900a3e8969c_initial_migration_with_all_core_models.py`)
- Creates all core tables with proper relationships
- Implements foreign key constraints
- Sets up basic indexes for unique fields

#### Performance Migration (`9ce070ba8747_add_indexes_and_constraints_for_.py`)
- Adds comprehensive indexes for query optimization
- Includes composite indexes for common query patterns
- Optimizes geospatial queries for location-based features
- Supports real-time tracking performance requirements

### 3. Pydantic Schemas ✅

Complete validation schemas implemented in `app/schemas/`:

#### User Schemas (`app/schemas/user.py`)
- **UserCreate**: Registration validation with password strength requirements
- **UserUpdate**: Profile update validation
- **UserResponse**: API response formatting
- **UserLogin**: Authentication validation
- **UserPasswordReset**: Password reset validation
- **UserPasswordUpdate**: Password change validation

#### Ride Schemas (`app/schemas/ride.py`)
- **LocationCreate/Response**: Location validation and formatting
- **RideCreate**: Ride request validation with business rules
- **RideUpdate**: Ride status and completion validation
- **RideResponse**: Complete ride information formatting
- **DriverLocationUpdate/Response**: Real-time location tracking
- **RideSearchFilters**: Query filtering and pagination

#### Payment Schemas (`app/schemas/payment.py`)
- **PaymentCreate**: Payment processing validation
- **PaymentUpdate**: Payment status updates
- **PaymentResponse**: Payment information formatting
- **PaymentMethodCreate/Response**: Payment method management
- **RefundCreate/Response**: Refund processing

### 4. Database Seeding Scripts ✅

Comprehensive seeding system implemented in `scripts/manage_db.py`:

#### Sample Data Created
- **Users**: 3 customers, 3 drivers, 1 admin user
- **Locations**: 5 sample locations in Lagos, Nigeria
- **Rides**: 3 completed rides with full lifecycle data
- **Payments**: 3 completed payments linked to rides
- **Driver Locations**: Real-time location data for all drivers

#### Management Commands
- `python scripts/manage_db.py check` - Database connection health check
- `python scripts/manage_db.py init` - Initialize database tables
- `python scripts/manage_db.py reset` - Reset database (development only)
- `python scripts/manage_db.py seed` - Seed with sample data

### 5. Database Configuration ✅

Complete database setup with:

#### Multi-Database Support
- SQLite for development (default)
- PostgreSQL for production
- Async database operations with SQLAlchemy 2.0

#### Connection Management
- Async session factory
- Connection pooling configuration
- Proper transaction handling
- Database health checks

### 6. Performance Optimizations ✅

Comprehensive indexing strategy:

#### Query Optimization Indexes
- **Users**: email, phone, user_type, status combinations
- **Rides**: customer_id, driver_id, status, timestamps, composite indexes
- **Payments**: user_id, ride_id, status, Stripe integration fields
- **Locations**: geospatial queries (lat/lng), city, country
- **Driver Locations**: availability, real-time updates, geospatial

#### Business Logic Indexes
- Customer ride history queries
- Driver assignment optimization
- Payment processing efficiency
- Real-time location tracking
- Admin dashboard queries
