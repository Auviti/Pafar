Verification test for Task 5: Implement secure payment processing system.

This test verifies that all sub-tasks have been completed:
- Create Payment model with transaction tracking ✓
- Integrate Stripe payment gateway for card processing ✓
- Build payment initiation endpoint with amount calculation ✓
- Implement payment confirmation and webhook handling ✓
- Create payment method tokenization for saved cards ✓
- Add payment failure handling and retry logic ✓
- Generate e-receipts with trip details ✓
- Write unit tests for payment service ✓
